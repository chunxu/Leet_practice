# description
# Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
# palindrome
# , and false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: x = 121
# Output: true
# Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
# Example 2:

# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# solution
